## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
```

#Hello_CircuitPython
#Turns the neopixel red and makes it blink
#Code Based of Example code from Engineering 3 Canvas

from time import time
import board
import neopixel
import time

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
dot.brightness = 0.5 

print("Make it red!")

while True:
dot.fill((255, 0, 0))
time.sleep(0.5)
dot.fill((0,0,0))
time.sleep(0.5)
```

### Wiring
There is no wiring needed because the neopixel is part of the board. 

### Reflection
 Importing things is very important. You can only use functions that are first imported and the files are put in the lib folder. 
 Unlike Arduino, the loop for circuit python is the "while true:" instead of void loop. 
 You need to check the serial monitor of the board to see if anything is wrong. The serial monitor on the computer is not as useful.
